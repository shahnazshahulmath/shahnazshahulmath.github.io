  <p>I am a second year PhD student at the Institut Math&eacutematiques de Toulouse under the supervision of Jean Gutt and Jean Fran√ßois Barraud. I am interested in symplectic and contact topology. I am also interested in their interactions with other fields of mathematics particularly low dimensional topology,hamiltonain dynamics,algebraic geometry and homotopy theory.   </p>
